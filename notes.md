## How Ties are Handled

Create two entries for the game, one where team x beats team y and one where team y beats team x

## First iteration

- Able to rank all teams in NFL against one another
- Predictions are not that accurate:
  - week 1: 0 (no data to use to predict)
  - week 2: 0.625
  - week 3: 0.47058823529411764
  - week 4: 0.6
  - week 5: 0.5714285714285714
  - week 6: 0.5
  - week 7: 0.5
  - week 8: 0.6428571428571429
  - week 9: 0.42857142857142855
  - week 10: 0.6428571428571429
- what other metrics can we factor into pagerank to make our predictions more accurate?
  - point differentials?
  - \# of injured players?
  - rank of teams that were beaten previously (maybe)?
